            <h2>Education and Background</h2>
                <p> My academic foundation includes a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Cell and Molecular Biology 
                    complemented by a minor in Psychology from Memorial University of Newfoundland. Following graduation, I strategically
                    transitioned from academic research to human resources, serving as a Staffing Advisor while self-learning computer programming. 
                    This multidisciplinary trajectory has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical thinking, human-centered approaches, and technical proficiency.

            <h2>Professional interests</h2>
                <p> 
                    My professional focus centers on understanding complex cognitive processes and leveraging insights into human information processing 
                    to enhance technological solutions. Drawing from extensive experience in behavioral analysis and human psychology, I excel in fostering 
                    meaningful professional relationships and implementing effective communication strategies. I am passionate about working in a team where I can 
                    apply interdisciplinary knowledge in innovative ways. I am dedicated to continuous academic and professional development 
                    while actively seeking opportunities to contribute to transformative projects that drive innovation and create meaningful impact.
